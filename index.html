          My name is Michael Ethridge, and I am 16 years old.
          I have been intrested in software devolpment since I was about 8, 
          mostly because I wanted to create my own game. Since then, my intrest in coding and software devolpment
          has only gotten stronger, with the hope that some day, I can work on helping to build websites for
          companies, clients, and others. I believe the future is in coding, and the sooner I have a start in the field,
          the better prepared I'll be for it.

          <h3>Security Project</h3>
          <p>
            In the security module, I had the task of working on the slide IoT devices.
            In this module, i was Network Security Specialist. Our task as a group was 
            to check which of the two given password managment softwares were better, 
            and to give our reasons as to why we picked a particular one, as well as specs.
            We also gave details on how passwords could be compromised, and we also gave details 
            on software and hardware that could compromise passwords. A link to our presentation can be found here:

          <p>
            In the data module, I had the task of managing my team, and of analyzing two data management tools: Qlik Data Sense
            and Google Data Studio. My role for this module was scrum master. As a group, we went over the pros and cons of each 
            tool, and gave which one would better benefit a small time company. A link to our presentation can be found here:

            In the devolpment module, I was tasked with building and designing a webpage on a fictional 
            power companies power centers. My partner and I built the page (Our Power Plants), and also built a CSS page for our
